## You need to answer the following question. 
Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries of student information but in different orders.
Do they give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching? if not, why? use the data you obtain from you code to 
explain your answer. 

Although the two binary search trees will contain the same number of entries, the fact that they are in a different order will ultimately change the performance between the two. In one file it is alphabetized and in the other it is not. The trees created from each file will be completely different. If you were to perform a key or firstname searching function, more steps would be needed in one tree compared to the other because each binary tree will be created differently due to the order of the files.
